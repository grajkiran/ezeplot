Ezeplot - Dynamical systems visualisation
=========================================

Ezeplot is a tool for visualising autonomous dynamical systems. It can be used as an educational aid for studying non-linear dynamics.

Main features
------------
* Plotting and animating trajectories of (1d, 2d, 3d) autonomous dynamical systems
* 2d, 3d and polar modes
* Plotting the nullclines, time-series and direction field
* Detecting fixed points based on user-input
* Plotting Poincare sections

Obtaining Ezeplot
-----------------

### Minimal package
The minimal package is very small (< 200KB) and consists of just the Ezeplot code. Download this package if you already have recent versions of python (2.7 or 3.4), matplotlib (>=1.3.1), numpy(>=1.8.1) and scipy(>=0.13.3) installed on your computer.
Download the minimal set of files and run.

### Fully self-contained standalone package
The standalone package is much larger (~ 40MB) and includes Ezeplot bundled along with python and the necessary libraries. Download, unzip and run - no installation required.
