Ezeplot - Dynamical systems visualisation
=========================================

Ezeplot is a tool for visualising non-linear autonomous dynamical systems. It
can be used as an educational aid for studying non-linear dynamics.

Main features
------------
* Plotting trajectories of arbitrary dynamical systems
* Animation of the trajectories
* 2D, 3D and polar modes
* Plotting the nullclines and direction field
* Detecting fixed points (beta)
* Poincare sections

Obtaining Ezeplot
-----------------

### Minimal package
The minimal package is very small (< 200KiB) and consists of just the ezeplot code. Download this package if you already have recent versions of python(2.7 or 3.4), matplotlib(>=1.3.1), numpy(>=1.8.1) and scipy(>=0.13.3) installed on your computer.
Download the minimal set of files and run.

### Fully self-contained standalone package
The standalone package is much larger (~ 40MiB) and includes ezeplot bundled along with python and the necessary libraries. Download, unzip and run - no installation required.
