What is Ezeplot?
----------------
Ezeplot is a tool for visualising non-linear autonomous dynamical systems. It
is intended to be used as an educational aid for studying non-linear dynamics.

Main features
------------
* Plotting trajectories of arbitrary dynamical systems
* 2D, 3D and polar modes
* Plotting the nullclines and direction field
* Detecting fixed points
* Animation of the trajectories
* Poincare sections
