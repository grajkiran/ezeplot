Third round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. User-defined. Name is EzePlot on top. Remove arrow next to x,y,z,t axis label.
	2. Linear damped oscillator not Oscillator, Simple pendulum, Van der Pol oscillator.
Done	3. BUG: No axis in 3d plots !
	4. Cursor location shift to bottom-left and truncate all entries to 4 decimal places. Should also work for 3-d plots.
	5. Write x=theta, y=r inside the panel. Shift title in polar mode up and make it bold. Make titles boldface in all plots.
Done	6. BUG: When shifting to Polar mode, it should automatically do the update for built-in models.
	7. Place simple pendulum and linear damped oscillator first in list of the pull-down menu.
	8. Place an About button on top left. It should popup a small gray screen with author name, contact email and version number as well website link and licensing information. Check pplane about button.
	9. Animate button when unpressed should continue at previous points.
	10. Poincare section: Automatically select the last trajectory for the section. Write “Equation of plane ax+by+cz+d=0”. Axis labelling.
	11. Red and yellow solid circles in Poincare section. Place an update button in this panel. Positioning of the Poincare section should overlap previous window and have grey border.
	12. Disable nullclines and quiver for 3d.
	13. Change location of graphs button and rename it as “Time series”. Put title “Time series”. Place Poincare button elsewhere and replace it with “Time series”.
	14. BUG: Do not allow the user to input initial trajectory location to be outside the xlim, ylim, zlim ranges.
	15. Shift Animate button down and out of current panel.
	16. Eliminate the initial position entry, this should be clickable on the 3D graph.
	17. While animating disable clicking new trajectories on the graph.

Second round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. Remove glider, glycolysis, linear system, modified Van der Pol, non-isolated fp, nonlinear centre. Add Rossler attractor, Belousov-Zhabotinski model. By default for the standard models pick some initial value and show appropriate phase portrait and not the nullcline.
Done	2. Nullclines not enabled by default.
Done	3. Change “Temporal” to “Graphs”
Done	4. Axis label of “Time”. Shift X,Y,Z to appropriate location. Write “Phase portrait” at top. Axis labels on the main graph with title.
Done	5. Shift Reset button to bottom, enlarge and make it red. Make update button blue and large and put in middle of free section.
Done	6. Place the “change limits” window in main panel and remove change plot button.
Done	7. Change of current cursor position to bottom-left.
Done	8. Remove arrow and initial point marked from graph.
Done	9. Reorganisation of main panel into sub-panels separated by line, with equation, domain, time step selection, remove current time-step from screen.
Done	10. Phase portrait (Polar) as title.
*fixed*	11. Move origin in 3d plot to centre and only plot x-y-z axis no grid lines.
*fixed*	12. All built-in models in dimensionless form and ranges are same.
Done	13. For 3d put in (x0,y0,z0) as box entry.
Done	14. Default colour scheme is blue curve with red dot.
Done	15. Allow 2 simultaneous portraits with different colours (blue, black).
*fixed*	16. If equations change then write “User-defined model”.
Done	17. If easy to implement then change “**” to “^”.
*fixed*	18. IMP: Always integrate upto Tmax and let the point move out of domain.
Done	19. Pressing update should first clear the screen.
Done	20. Disallow more than 5-letter parameter names
*fixed*	21. Enable z_dot entry only if 3d is elected. Otherwise grey it out.
Done	22. Add info message on top-right when in polar mode appropriately saying r=x, theta=y
Done	23. BUG: Reset when selecting new model.

First round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
done  1. Remove bar below parameter entry value.
done  2. Fix 0,0 location in Cartesian graph
done  3. Remove uniform option, keep it as default.
      4. Introduce isocline.
done  5. Introduce X-t, Y-t, X-Y, X-Y-Z check buttons on front panel
done  6. Polar not Polar mode
done  7. Disallow more than 10 parameters.
done  8. Increase size of Update button and place at bottom of panel
done  9. Put axis numbers outside the graph.
done  10. Remove "Phase plane" from top.
done  11. Get rid of icons at bottom from Python.
done  12. Graph spacing is mismatched for X-t, Y-t plots, check.
done  13. Bug ! Check coordinate system info on bottom right in X-t, Y-t graphs.
