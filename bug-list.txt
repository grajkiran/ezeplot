Second round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. Remove glider, glycolysis, linear system, modified Van der Pol, non-isolated fp, nonlinear centre. Add Rossler attractor, Belousov-Zhabotinski model. By default for the standard models pick some initial value and show appropriate phase portrait and not the nullcline.
Done	2. Nullclines not enabled by default.
Done	3. Change “Temporal” to “Graphs”
Done	4. Axis label of “Time”. Shift X,Y,Z to appropriate location. Write “Phase portrait” at top. Axis labels on the main graph with title.
	5. Shift Reset button to bottom, enlarge and make it red. Make update button blue and large and put in middle of free section.
	6. Place the “change limits” window in main panel and remove change plot button.
Done	7. Change of current cursor position to bottom-left.
Done	8. Remove arrow and initial point marked from graph.
	9. Reorganisation of main panel into sub-panels separated by line, with equation, domain, time step selection, remove current time-step from screen.
Done	10. Phase portrait (Polar) as title.
	11. Move origin in 3d plot to centre and only plot x-y-z axis no grid lines.
	12. All built-in models in dimensionless form and ranges are same.
	13. For 3d put in (x0,y0,z0) as box entry.
Done	14. Default colour scheme is blue curve with red dot.
Done	15. Allow 2 simultaneous portraits with different colours (blue, black).
*fixed*	16. If equations change then write “User-defined model”.
	17. If easy to implement then change “**” to “^”.
	18. IMP: Always integrate upto Tmax and let the point move out of domain.
Done	19. Pressing update should first clear the screen.
Done	20. Disallow more than 5-letter parameter names
*fixed*	21. Enable z_dot entry only if 3d is elected. Otherwise grey it out.
Done	22. Add info message on top-right when in polar mode appropriately saying r=x, theta=y
Done	23. BUG: Reset when selecting new model.

First round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
done  1. Remove bar below parameter entry value.
done  2. Fix 0,0 location in Cartesian graph
done  3. Remove uniform option, keep it as default.
      4. Introduce isocline.
done  5. Introduce X-t, Y-t, X-Y, X-Y-Z check buttons on front panel
done  6. Polar not Polar mode
done  7. Disallow more than 10 parameters.
done  8. Increase size of Update button and place at bottom of panel
done  9. Put axis numbers outside the graph.
done  10. Remove "Phase plane" from top.
done  11. Get rid of icons at bottom from Python.
done  12. Graph spacing is mismatched for X-t, Y-t plots, check.
done  13. Bug ! Check coordinate system info on bottom right in X-t, Y-t graphs.
