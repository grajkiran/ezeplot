Fifth round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. Rotation with left button+drag. Single click of left button is
	   new trajectory.
Done	2. Why is Lorenz attractor giving a free projection upon window
	   resize ?
Done	3. x,Y,Z axes ? Phase portrait (XYZ), Phase portrait (rtheta)
Done	4. For User-defined it should clear equation entries and only
	   include timestep related info. Other entries clear.
Done	5. Dynamical systems visualization
	6. Phase portrait polar, only have rmax as an option. Its confusing
	   otherwise.
	7. 3d plot goes outside the defined axes ? Coordinate points are
	   still being output at bottom-left: Can anything be done about it
	   ?
	8. About button under File. It should popup a small screen with
	   author name and affiliation, contact email, version number as
	   well as website link and licensing information.
Done	9. Exit button on Poincare section window.
	10. Poincare section window is missing boldface title. Remove
	    “From, To” and Equation of plane. Only state “Direction of
	    intersecting plane” and “Location” bar with end-points and
	    current point location displayed.
Done	11. Remove First Return Map option.
Done	12. Use “*” symbol for fixed point and have it as an option. Use
	    ranges specified by user for calculation and do max number of
	    steps possible by Python.
Done	13. BUG: User is able to input initial trajectory location outside
	    the xlim, ylim, zlim ranges in 3D !
Done	14. BUG: For any model, on opting for diff coordinate system
	    (polar), recalculate the graph. Take care of Polar - 3D
	    changeover.
Done	15. In any plot circle through all colors permitted by Python
Done	16. Remove “End points” option and color intersecting plane as
	    yellow.  Remove “Auto-align” option.
	17. Move print statements to logging

Fourth round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. Polar mode: Redraw panel to only show rlim with 0 [gray] rlim
	   [entry]. In graph only show rlim value at edge nothing inside
	   the circle.
Done	2. Remove Duffing
Done	3. Parameters should be ordered according to equation order - its
	   annoying otherwise.
Done	4. Quiver - thinner arrowheads
*fixed*	5. Poincare section: Simple 2-d graph with single pixel points.
Done	6. Van der Pol: Change mu to 2.5
Done	7. Poincare First-Return map as 2-d plot as an option.
Done	8. Print option for all graphs, icon on top-left.
Done	9. Fixed points option with initial position specified by user:
Done	   Check pplane in this regard for radius.
Done	10. BUG: Nullclines – make dot-dash line, or its confused with
	    trajectories

Third round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. User-defined. Name is EzePlot on top. Remove arrow next to
	   x,y,z,t axis label.
Done	2. Linear damped oscillator not Oscillator, Simple pendulum, Van
	   der Pol oscillator.
Done	3. BUG: No axis in 3d plots !
Done	4. Cursor location shift to bottom-left and truncate all entries to
	   4 decimal places. Should also work for 3-d plots.
Done	5. Write x=theta, y=r inside the panel. Shift title in polar mode
	   up and make it bold. Make titles boldface in all plots.
Done	6. BUG: When shifting to Polar mode, it should automatically do the
	   update for built-in models.
Done	7. Place simple pendulum and linear damped oscillator first in list
	   of the pull-down menu.
	8. Place an About button on top left. It should popup a small gray
	   screen with author name, contact email and version number as
	   well website link and licensing information. Check pplane about
	   button.
Done	9. Animate button when unpressed should continue at previous
	   points.  9a. Restart animation from beginning option
Done	10. Poincare section: Automatically select the last trajectory for
	    the section. Write “Equation of plane ax+by+cz+d=0”. Axis
	    labelling.
Done	11. Red and yellow solid circles in Poincare section. Place an
	    update button in this panel. Positioning of the Poincare
	    section should overlap previous window and have grey border.
Done	12. Disable nullclines and quiver for 3d.
Done	13. Change location of graphs button and rename it as “Time
	    series”. Put title “Time series”. Place Poincare button
	    elsewhere and replace it with “Time series”.
Done	14. BUG: Do not allow the user to input initial trajectory location
	    to be outside the xlim, ylim, zlim ranges.
Done	15. Shift Animate button down and out of current panel.
Done	16. Eliminate the initial position entry, this should be clickable
	    on the 3D graph.
Done	17. While animating disable clicking new trajectories on the graph.
Done	18. Make Lorentz attractor as default model. Its the most famous
	    and dramatic model from your list.

Second round:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Done	1. Remove glider, glycolysis, linear system, modified Van der Pol,
	   non-isolated fp, nonlinear centre. Add Rossler attractor,
	   Belousov-Zhabotinski model. By default for the standard models
	   pick some initial value and show appropriate phase portrait and
	   not the nullcline.
Done	2. Nullclines not enabled by default.
Done	3. Change “Temporal” to “Graphs”
Done	4. Axis label of “Time”. Shift X,Y,Z to appropriate location. Write
	   “Phase portrait” at top. Axis labels on the main graph with
	   title.
Done	5. Shift Reset button to bottom, enlarge and make it red. Make
	   update button blue and large and put in middle of free section.
Done	6. Place the “change limits” window in main panel and remove change
	   plot button.
Done	7. Change of current cursor position to bottom-left.
Done	8. Remove arrow and initial point marked from graph.
Done	9. Reorganisation of main panel into sub-panels separated by line,
	   with equation, domain, time step selection, remove current
	   time-step from screen.
Done	10. Phase portrait (Polar) as title.
*fixed*	11. Move origin in 3d plot to centre and only plot x-y-z axis no
	    grid lines.
*fixed*	12. All built-in models in dimensionless form and ranges are same.
Done	13. For 3d put in (x0,y0,z0) as box entry.
Done	14. Default colour scheme is blue curve with red dot.
Done	15. Allow 2 simultaneous portraits with different colours (blue,
	    black).
*fixed*	16. If equations change then write “User-defined model”.
Done	17. If easy to implement then change “**” to “^”.
*fixed*	18. IMP: Always integrate upto Tmax and let the point move out of
	    domain.
Done	19. Pressing update should first clear the screen.
Done	20. Disallow more than 5-letter parameter names
*fixed*	21. Enable z_dot entry only if 3d is elected. Otherwise grey it out.
Done	22. Add info message on top-right when in polar mode appropriately
	    saying r=x, theta=y
Done	23. BUG: Reset when selecting new model.
